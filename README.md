# `doitoml`

> Load declarative tasks for [doit] from TOML, JSON, YAML, and other files.

## Install

> > **TBD** for now, see the [contributing guide] for a development install.
>
> |         `pip`         |   `conda` (or `mamba`, `micromamba`)   |
> | :-------------------: | :------------------------------------: |
> | `pip install doitoml` | `conda install -c conda-forge doitoml` |

## Features

- **declarative** automation in a **single** `pyproject.toml`, or...
  - well-known configuration paths like `package.json`
  - any number of namespaced TOML, JSON, or YAML files
    - from any key inside them
  - augment and simplify existing `dodo.py` workflows
- reuse and transform **paths** and shell tokens
  - use **globs** and transforms to capture relationships between transformed files
- flexibly configure **environment** variables
- use **templates** like Jinja2 and JSON-e for advanced use cases
- user-defined Python-based **actions** and **up-to-date** checkers
- control the **working directory** and **log paths** of processes and actions
- extensibility in any part of the task definition process
  - all functionality implemented as `entry_point`-based plugins

## Usage

`doitoml` provides no additional command line abilities, and is meant to drop in to the
existing `doit` CLI.

### A Simple Example

> **Note**
>
> The `doitoml` [GitHub] repository has many examples of different configurations,
> including the project's own `pyproject.toml` and `package.json`.
>
> The [full documentation][docs] includes more information about building concise,
> declarative, reproducible tasks for your project.

The simplest way to use `doitoml` needs only a `pyproject.toml`, which `doit` will
already check for configuration data.

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["doitoml"]

[tool.doit]
loader = "doitoml"
verbosity = 2

[tool.doitoml.tasks.hello]
actions = ['echo "Hello World!"']
```

After installing the `dev` extra dependency...

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

... and running ...

```bash
doit
```

... you would see ...

```bash
.  hello:
Hello World!
```
